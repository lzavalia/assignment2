Integration Manager workflow has each developer pushes to a public repository
specific to them and then the integration manager pushes that to the central
repository while in Dictator and Lieutenants workflow there are several
"lieutenant repositories" that a developer will be assigned to, the
lieutenants then push to the dictator who then pushes to the central repo.

the workflow to proceed in an organized fashion in which developers can
concentrate on more specific problems while in a centralized workflow there
would be more chaos
